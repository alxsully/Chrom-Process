# Chrom-Process
Python processing of GC-MS chromatograms 


The 5 standard files were not exactly labeled w/r/t ppm. The actual values are 0.9904, 2.476,4.952,7.428, and 9.904 ppm.

Added 4 new chromatograms. These had unknown concentrations of nicotine. Using Xcalibur and the given standards, the concentrations
were calculated to be 
A - 6.820 ppm
B - 3.163 ppm
C - 0.798 ppm
D - 3.170 ppm
